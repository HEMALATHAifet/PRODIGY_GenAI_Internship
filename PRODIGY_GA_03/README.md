# 📚 TASK 3 – TEXT GENERATION WITH MARKOV CHAINS

## 🔖 Problem Statement
**TASK3 - TEXT GENERATION WITH MARKOV CHAINS**  
Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This task involves creating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a character or word based on the previous one(s).

---

## 📝 Task Explanation

In this task, I implemented a **Markov Chain-based Text Generator** in Python using **Gradio** for an interactive web interface. The goal was to learn how statistical models can generate new sequences based on input patterns.

I used a **word-level Markov Chain** model to learn from a given text and generate new sentences that resemble the style of the input.

---

## 🚧 Approach and Steps

1. **Understand the concept of Markov Chains** in the context of text generation.
2. Choose between **character-based** and **word-based** modeling.
3. Implement the Markov Chain logic in Python.
4. Create a simple interactive app using **Gradio** in Google Colab.
5. Test the model with various prefix lengths and observe the behavior.
6. Document the results and findings.

## 🔠 Character-based vs Word-based Text Generation

| Type            | Based On             | Example                   |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Character-based | Predicts next letter | "Hel" → "l", "Hell" → "o" |
| Word-based      | Predicts next word   | "I love" → "coding"       |

### ✅ What I Chose & Why:
I chose **Word-Based Text Generation** because:
- It produces more meaningful and grammatically correct sentences.
- It is easier to interpret the output.
- Suitable for short and medium-length inputs commonly used in demos.

## 🎯 Title: **Text Generation with Markov Chains**

### ✳️ What is "Text Generation"?

It means **creating new text automatically** (like a story or sentence) using some logic.

For example:
If your original text is:

> “I like to eat ice cream.”

You want the computer to **learn the style of this sentence** and generate something new like:

> “I like to eat pizza too.”

---

## 🧠 What is a **Markov Chain**?

A **Markov Chain** is a mathematical model that helps in making predictions based on past values.

👉 In text generation, Markov Chains are used to **predict the next word or character** based on the **previous one (or two, or more)**.

Let me explain with a **simple word example**:

Imagine your text is:

> "I love to code. I love to learn."

Now, let's say you want to know what word comes **after "I"**.

* You look at your text and find:

  * "I love"
  * "I love" again

So, after "I", the word "love" comes often. So, next time you see "I", you might guess the next word is "love".

That’s what Markov Chain does — it learns such **patterns** and uses them to **generate new text**.

---

## 🔄 How Does the Code Work?

### 1. **Input some sample text**

For example:

```python
sample_text = "This is a sample text for generating text using Markov Chains."
````

### 2. **Build a Markov chain model**

* The model will go through the text.
* It will remember which **words (or letters)** usually come **after** which ones.

### 3. **Generate new text**

* It starts with a random word.
* Then, using the pattern it learned, it predicts the next word or character.
* It keeps doing this and builds a new sentence.

---

## 🚀 How to Use the App

1. Paste any paragraph in the first textbox. Example:

```
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge from data.
```

2. Choose a **Prefix Length (n)**:

   * How many previous words the model should consider.
   * `2` is a good starting point.

3. Choose the **number of words to generate** (e.g., 50).

4. Click **Submit**.

## ⚠️ Why It Failed When `prefix_length=5`

When I gave a short input and selected `prefix_length = 5`, the output looked exactly the same as the input.

That’s because:

### ✅ Key Point: **Markov Chains Do Not Invent New Words**

A Markov Chain **does not generate new vocabulary** — it **rearranges existing words** based on what it learned from the input.

### ✨ What it *can* do:

* Mix and match the words in **new order**.
* Combine fragments from different parts of your input.
* Create variations like:

  > "Artificial intelligence is a subset of learning without being explicitly programmed."

### ❌ What it *cannot* do:

* It cannot invent new words like a neural network would.
* It won’t work well on very short input texts because it has no room to mix words.

---

## ✅ How to Verify It’s Working

Here’s how to **check that it’s generating new text and not just copying input**:

### ✅ Step 1: Use a Long Training Text

```text
Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data. These systems identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. Neural networks mimic the way humans learn.
```

### ✅ Step 2: Use `prefix_length = 2` or `3`, `output_length = 50`

Now the model has enough material to:

* Learn different 2-word combinations (prefixes)
* Choose a next word based on those combinations
* Form new and meaningful chains

### ✅ Step 3: Watch for New Sequences

Example output might be:

> "Machine learning is a method of AI based on the idea that systems can learn from data. These systems identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention."

This is a *newly formed sequence* from parts of the paragraph — that's a **working Markov model**!

## ✅ Tips to Ensure You See Generation

| Action                                | Why                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Give longer training input            | So the chain has more paths to choose from     |
| Lower prefix length (2 or 3)          | Higher values are too strict and limit choices |
| Watch for word *order*, not new words | Markov just rearranges known words             |

---

## 🧪 Want to Test It Like a Scientist?

Use this simple check:

```python
output = generate_markov_text(input_text, 2, 50)
print("Generated Output:\n", output)

# Check if it's exactly same as input
if output in input_text:
    print("❌ Looks like it's repeating input. Try lower n or more input.")
else:
    print("✅ This is a new sequence!")
```

---

## 💡 Final Note

If you want the model to **generate completely new text** like ChatGPT, you'll need models like:

* RNNs / LSTMs
* GPT (transformers)

But for simple shuffling of style-preserved text, **Markov Chains are great**!
